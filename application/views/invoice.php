                <p>With recurring invoices, you can use <a href="#" target="_blank">automatic payments</a>—save your customer's credit card information once during invoice create, and they will be billed each time an invoice generates. If you prefer, you can instead use manual payments, where your customer pays the invoice manually each time they receive it, or you can <a href="#" target="_blank">securely save their card information</a> and process the payment on your end each time. For more information, please see <a href="#">Payments</a> details and our <a href="#" target="_blank">Guide to Wave Payments</a>.</p>

              <button class="accordion ">Will I have to do any manual work each time?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>No! When you create a recurring invoice, you can automate your payments and customize the schedule according to when you'd like your invoices to be generated. If you or your customer would like to make changes, you can choose to end the recurring schedule at any time.</p>

              <button class="accordion ">Does Wave offer recurring invoicing?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>We sure do! Wave's recurring billing feature automates your business invoicing process, allowing you to schedule everything from invoice creation and sending to payment collection and sending overdue payment reminders to customers.</p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion ">What payment methods can my customers use?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Your customers can pay the invoices you send them instantly by credit card, secure bank payment (ACH/EFT), or Apple Pay.

              <button class="accordion ">How do I calculate taxes on my invoices?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>A common issue when invoicing in Microsoft Word, Excel, or other DIY solutions is making calculation errors. Wave's invoicing software for small businesses removes the worry of making these errors because calculations are done for you, including the taxes.</p>

              <button class="accordion ">How is a digital invoice different from a paper-based invoice?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Electronic invoices are created with online invoicing software or other cloud-based services, which makes it easy to automate the invoicing process. Electronic invoices also provide small business owners with professional-looking digital invoices that their customers can pay easily online through a system like Wave’s online payments.
                    On the other hand, paper-based invoicing is a manual process requiring extra time for things like invoice tracking and following up on overdue invoices, which can keep you away from the best parts of running your small business.</p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion ">What are the benefits of digital invoicing?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Manually creating invoices in Microsoft Word or Excel can be time-consuming and difficult to manage. Digital invoicing empowers your small business by automating invoice processing and saving time by tracking key invoice data like upcoming and outstanding invoices. You can also manage late payments more efficiently through e-invoicing by setting up payment reminders to send to your customers before an invoice due date.</p>

              <button class="accordion ">Is invoicing software helpful for freelancers?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Absolutely! Whether you're a freelance writer, a freelance editor, a freelance front-end developer, or even a freelance balloon maker (no articles on that yet, sorry), you can use invoicing software to send professional looking invoices to your clients and get paid faster.</p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion ">How do I know what to charge when invoicing my freelance clients?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>The rate that you charge for your freelancing services can vary, so it's important to get a grasp of market trends before sending your clients an invoice or quoting a price. Freelance rates can differ depending on experience level and industry. For example, the rate a freelance web developer charges may be different than that of a freelance graphic designer, because each freelancer specializes in a different area.</p>
